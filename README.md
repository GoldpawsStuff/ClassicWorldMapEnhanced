Simple addon for WoW Classic that makes the WorldMap a little easier to work with, and adds some quality of life features. It currently has no user configurable settings. 

## **Features:**  
- Shrinks the world map down to a manageable size.
- Prevents the world map from blocking out the world visually. 
- Prevents the world map from blocking user movement and input when map is visible. 
- Makes the map slightly transparent when the player is moving, to easier spot mobs and hostile players. 
- Shows player- and mouse cursor coordinates. 
- Shows zone quest levels.
